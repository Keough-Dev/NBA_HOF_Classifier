Scraping NBA statistics and running machine learning models to predict probabilities of players being in the Hall of Fame

Overall the code could have been slightly more modular in regards to the webscraping aspects, but considering the large differences in data needed from any given page and the fact that this code was moreso for analysis and results than being pushed to production or proposed for revision, I opted to separate some of the scraping tasks individually.
